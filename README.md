Collections of hooks and providers to make development on top of the aave contracts and pools a breeze.

## Development

### Install the packages

`yarn`

### Run the example apps

### Contribute to the sdk

The core hooks and logics of the sdk are located unders `/packages/react-sdk`.

While running `yarn dev`, any edit to the files should be reflected in real-time in the example apps.
